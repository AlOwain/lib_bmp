# lib\_bmp

This library is very limited, I wrote it initially to use it in [BMPLL](https://github.com/AlOwain/bmpll). It actually barely functions properly. It does not support most BMP features, but it could read a very plain uncompressed 24-bit color depth bitmap image. I might extend it as needed in the future. A tutorial and better documentation as well as actual compiled releases are unplanned but I might do them some time in the future.
